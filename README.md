# Malware-Analysis-Scripts
This repository contains personally developed scripts which automate common malware analysis tasks, such as string decryption and configuration extraction. The scripts are not perfect, so any feedback is welcomed.

Every sample mentioned by its SHA256 hash value is available on [MalwareBazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/) or [Hatching Triage](https://tria.ge/).
